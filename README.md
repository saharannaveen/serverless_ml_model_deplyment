# serverless_ml_model_deplyment
this is a sample app build to show how we can deploy machine learning model as serverless. 
Web app accepts inputs from user, pass it to the service running on AWS lambda.

Event triggers lambda and does the prediction and response is sent back to the Webapp. 

I have shown - Regression model, one NLP and one image classification.
